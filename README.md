# Navigation-Problem
Using BFS, DFS and GFBS(Greedy Best First Search) to implement and compare the performance of these algorithms on a navigation problem i.e. path-finding.

Instructions for compiling and running the main.cpp file :

The code is in C++ under the file name main.cpp

The code takes the input file ATMgraph.txt automatically.

While running the .cpp program, keep the name of the text file as ATMgraph.txt and make sure that the file is inside 
the current folder where .cpp file stays.

Build and run the cpp file and then follow the instructions on the command line. 

Options are given for BFS, DFS and GBFS. Enter the appropriate number to run that particular search.
e.g.
	
	Enter option for Search 
	1 Breadth-First Search
	2 Depth-First Search
	3 Greedy Best-First Search
	4 Exit
	1

Then command prompt will ask to enter x and y co-ordinates of start and end nodes. Enter with a space. 
e.g.
	
	Enter source co-ordinates
	1 1
	Enter destination co-ordinates
	4 4
After this the program will print the statistics related to that particular search and again repeat based on the user input. 
In order to exit the process, enter 4.
